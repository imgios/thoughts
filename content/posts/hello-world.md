What the hell is this?

Well, you probably already know me because this miniblog is born with the aim to:

- share my thoughts just with my friends;
- improve my english skills;
- getting started with static websites and Hugo.

Nothing more, nothing less. Otherwise, let me introduce myself.

My name is Giosu√®, a Computer Science MSc student from Caserta, in love with tech. I really like to talk about tech and related, share my thoughts and know yours. This blog is secretly born in a hidden GitHub repository and shared just with few contacts. Anyway, since you're here, feel free to comment any post if you want to share your opinion about things that I post.

Cya.
