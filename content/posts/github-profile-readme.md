Recently, GitHub has introduced the profile-level README feature, that allows user to have a customizable box in their own GitHub profile.

[![Profile README Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=imgios&repo=imgios&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/imgios/imgios)
                                                                                                                                    
## What is it?

GitHub, with this feature, let you create a README.md file that is shown in your GitHub profile. This can be useful in order to give further information about yourself more than the profile bio.
There are hundred of cool things made by the community that can be used in your README, such as:
- GitHub stats
- GitHub top languages
- Extra pins
- Wakatime stats
- Latest blog posts list dynamically updated
- Visitors count

..and much more!

## How to create your own README
Creating your README is as easy as ABC.
- **Step 1:** Create a repository named the same as your GitHub username.
*Example: my GitHub username is imgios, the repository is named imgios.*
- **Step 2:** Create the README.md file in the repository and add your cool things in it.
- **Step 3:** Commit and see your README.md file in your profile!
