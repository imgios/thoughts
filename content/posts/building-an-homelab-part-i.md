Spare hardware, Raspberry Pis, servers and mini PCs. What are they? Is it a shopping list? Well, no. These are things that IT enthusiasts usually use to set up a homelab.

Homelabs are made to address different needs and/or purposes. They can be a place to learn and experiment or a safe environment with some services. Some common use cases are:
- Build an own private cloud to store your files
- Build your own streaming platform (for educational purposes ðŸ‘€)
- Build an ephemeral playground for a specific topic

## Why am I building an homelab?

In my case, I'm building it to explore a bit more several topics, such as:
- System administration
- Self-hosting some services
- A bit of home automation
- Experiment new topic (e.g., GitOps)
