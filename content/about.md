If you are browsing this blog probably you already know me, if not keep reading.

Hi, my name is Giosuè and I'm from Caserta, Italy. I'm in love with computers and everything around them. I love to share the things that I like with other people. This mini blog is secretly born in order to share my thoughts about tech-things with my friends. Have fun reading my posts and feel free to comment any post if you want to share your thoughts with me!
